# INFO474-FinalProject

Our group will be analyzing a dataset about ​H-1B petitions from [2011 - 2016​ fromKaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa). We have chosen this dataset as it fulfills the project requirements (includinglatitude and longitude data). Moreover, since our group members are all international students,we feel it is very relevant to our future career. Our main question would be “What are the factorsthat impact the chance of one obtaining an H1B visa?” In our opinion, being able to know thepast history of the H1B petition would not only inform international students of their potentialchance of working in the United States but also help direct their future career choices.

* We use d3 to create an interactive map to display the geographic location of the H1B visa petition to figure out how the number of H1B visa petition varies in different states and cities. (Mengjiao)

* What is the trend of average salary of H-1B intended workers? We used a line plot to show the average salary by year, filtered by case status. The tooltip shows a box and whisker plot of the salaries. (Vanessa)

* We use Tableau to construct a pie chart to show employees on which position in a company is more likely to file an H1B visa petition, for example, data scientist, soft engineer or program manager? (Chuqian Yin)
